# JS Box

JS Box is a bolierplate Docker for MERN (MongoDB + Express + React + Node) OR MEAN (MongoDB + Express + Angular + Node), all served by Nginx.

It is prepared to run both in **development** as in **production** mode, so you can easily create your project with a ready-made base. This should speed up the creation of Node apps using any of these stacks.

In the development mode, both server and client files are updated in Docker as they are changed in your host machine.

In the production mode, React is compiled and the static files are served through Nginx.

# Configuration

To configure JS Box, make a copy of `.env example` and save it as `.env` and change the configurations to suit your needs.

```
### development OR production
JS_BOX_ENVIRONMENT=production # development allows live reloading of client and server
### react OR angular
JS_BOX_CLIENT=react
JS_BOX_NGINX_PORT=80          # the Docker port that will be accessible on the host
JS_BOX_NGINX_HOST=localhost   # the URL of the system
JS_BOX_MONGODB_PORT=9090      # The port to be able to access MongoDB on the host
```

## Available external ports

Nginx main server accessible on the port defined in JS_BOX_NGINX_PORT

MongoDB accessible on the port defined in JS_BOX_MONGODB_PORT

# Development mode

Running in with `JS_BOX_ENVIRONMENT` as development uses the host's `node_module` folder both for the clients and the API, so, before running `docker-compose up` you need to go to each folder (client and API) and run

```
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies in the host machine that will be used by the Docker machine.

## Accessing the machines

To access the Docker machines, you can use the command

```
docker exec -it js-box-DOCKER_NAME /bin/bash
```

Replace `DOCKER_NAME` by the name and environemnt of the machine you wish to acces.

I.e.

```
docker exec -it js-box-client-development-angular /bin/bash
```

or

```
docker exec -it js-box-client-production-react /bin/bash
```

or

```
docker exec -it js-box-nginx /bin/bash
```

# Env vars

To expose environment vars, you need to edit some specific files:

## Angular

On the client-angular, in `src/environments`, edit the `environment-template.ts` file to include env vars you want to be able to acces in Angular.

## React

You need to expose the env vars on the `.docker-client-react-XXX.dockerfile` file, always adding `REACT_APP` in the begining of the var name so the React app is able to access it.

# Running

After configuring the system, simply run

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Docker will build the images and containers and run in the background.

To stop the containers, run

```
docker-compose stop
```


If you want to delete ALL images and containers from Docker, you can run

```
docker system prune -a
```

# Available scripts

While the containers are running you can easily access them using the provided `.bat` (Windows) or `.sh` (Unix) scripts.

# Log files

Log files generated by the servers running on Docker will be also accessible on the host in the `logs` folder.

Each server saves logs in their specific folder.

# Wishlist

[ ] find a way to expose env vars to React app that doesn't involve editing the `.dockerfile`!
