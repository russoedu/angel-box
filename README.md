# JS Box

JS Box is a bolierplate Docker for server + client + DB stacks.

The current version implements the following stacks:

- MERN ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/) + [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Node](https://nodejs.org/));
- MEAN ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/) + [Angular](https://angular.io/) + [Node](https://nodejs.org/));
- MEVN ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/) + [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) + [Node](https://nodejs.org/)).

All these versions are proxied by an [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) server. 

JS Box is prepared to run both in **development** as in **production** mode, so you can easily create your project with a ready-made base. This should speed up the creation of client/server apps using any of these stacks.

<a name="back1"></a>In the development mode, both server and client files are updated in Docker as they are changed in your host machine<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>.

In the production mode, the client is compiled in the `build` folder and the static files are served through Nginx.

# Configuration

To configure JS Box, make a copy of `.env example` and save it as `.env` and change the configurations to suit your needs.

```
### development OR production
JS_BOX_ENVIRONMENT=production
### react OR angular OR vue
JS_BOX_CLIENT=react
JS_BOX_NGINX_PORT=80          # the Docker port that will be accessible externally
JS_BOX_NGINX_HOST=localhost   # the URL to be accessible externally
JS_BOX_MONGODB_PORT=9090      # The port to be able to access MongoDB externally
### Only used for development mode
JS_BOX_DEV_CLIENT_PORT=3000   # the Docker port in DEVELOPMENT mode that will let the client be accessible externally
JS_BOX_DEV_API_PORT=4000      # the Docker port in DEVELOPMENT mode that will let the API be accessible externally
```

## Available external ports

Nginx main server accessible on the port defined in `JS_BOX_NGINX_PORT`.

MongoDB accessible on the port defined in `JS_BOX_MONGODB_PORT`.

In development mode, the client can be accessed on port `JS_BOX_DEV_CLIENT_PORT` and the API on port `JS_BOX_DEV_API_PORT`. **In production mode, these ports are closed**.

# Development mode

Running in with `JS_BOX_ENVIRONMENT` as **development** uses the host's `node_module` folder both for the client you chose and the API, so, before running `docker-compose up` you need to go to each folder (client and API) and run.

```
npm install
```

<a name="back2"></a>This will install all dependencies in the host machine that will be used by the Docker machine.<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>

## Accessing the machines

To access the Docker machines, you can use the command:

```
docker exec -it js-box-DOCKER_NAME /bin/bash
```

Replace `DOCKER_NAME` by the name and environment of the machine you wish to access, I.e.:

```
docker exec -it js-box-client-development-angular /bin/bash
```

or

```
docker exec -it js-box-client-production-react /bin/bash
```

or

```
docker exec -it js-box-nginx-production-react /bin/bash
```

# Environment variables

To expose env vars to the clients, you need to edit some specific files. The API doesn't need any configuration, all vars set in the `.env` file are accessible by the API app.

JS Box replaces all vars set in the root `.env` with the ones set in these configs files using the special `${VAR_NAME}` variable.

## Angular

On the client-angular, on `src/environments`, edit the `env-template.ts` file to include env vars you want to be able to access in Angular. 

## React

On the client-react, edit the `env-template` file to include env vars you want to be able to access in React.

**React only has access to vars if their name begins with `REACT_APP`.**

## Vue

On the client-vue, edit the `env-template` file to include env vars you want to be able to access in Vue.

**Vue only has access to vars if their name begins with `VUE_APP`.**

# Running

After configuring the system via the `.env` file, run:

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Docker will build the containers and images and run in the background. Remove the `-d` option to run in the foreground. Use `CONTROL + C` to stop it. <sup>[more about Docker](#docker)</sup>

To stop the containers, run:

```
docker-compose stop
```


If you want to delete ALL images and containers from Docker, you can run:

```
prune
```

# Log files

Log files generated by the servers running on Docker will be also accessible on the host in the `logs` folder.

Each server saves logs in their specific folder.

# About

This project started as a learning process to better understand Docker, docker-compose. After creating the first version with [React](https://reactjs.org/), I decided to include [Angular](https://angular.io/), so I could better understand the differences.

Later on, after everything was working, I decided to include [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

## Clients

All the clients behave the same, with the same functionalities, the same ability to access environment variables (in different ways, check the instructions).

I tried my best to name files, components and methods the same, use the same logical behaviour, but needed to adapt some parts where the frameworks differ.

I have plans to keep expanding this project with new UI frameworks and maybe other backends, also.

## Docker-compose version

I decided to use docker-compose version 2 because it allows me to use `extends` and create different configurations for dev and prod. Version 3 lost this ability.

<a name="docker"></a>

## Docker

It took me a while to understand Docker, what runs when, when the files from the host are mounted, when should I run npm install, when to run build.

# TODO / Wish list

- [ ] Protect MongoDB with a password, as it can be accessed externally.
- [ ] https://hapi.dev/
- [ ] https://koajs.com/
- [ ] Other DBs???
- [ ] https://lumen.laravel.com/ ???
- [ ] Understand and maybe implement Webpack compilation on all versions

# Footnotes

<a name="footnote1">1</a>: Some issues might occour, mostly when installing new packages via NPM, as they might have different native version from your host machine and the Docker container. <sup>[back](#back1)</sup>

<a name="footnote2">2</a>: In development mode, Docker executes `npm rebuild` before starting to make sure native dependencies are replaced to match the Docker container environment. <sup>[back](#back2)</sup>
